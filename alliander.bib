  abstract = {In this article we justify why justice ought to be considered in scenarios of energy transitions, stipulate what dimensions should reasonably be considered, and investigate whether such considerations are taken in Swedish parliamentary debates on energy policies. Through interviews we investigated how Swedish parliamentary politicians think through justice in energy transitions, providing a practical perspective. We conclude that while there is some overlap between minimal conditions for energy justice and the issues brought forward by Swedish politicians, several issues are omitted. Examples include procedural justice and recognizing Sámi interests. On the other hand, principles of energy justice omit economic issues, which are however often brought up by respondents. It can be argued that justice issues, and not only the technical and economic issues that currently dominate the political debate, should be considered in energy transitions. It is therefore unfortunate that questions about justice are not adequately recognized by Swedish members of parliament, as outlined here by interview results. Stronger conclusions would require more empirical work, but the article points out several discrepancies between the topics discussed in the research literature on energy policies, and the topics discussed by elected parliamentarians having a specific focus on energy policies.  Keywords: energy justice; energy transitions; Swedish energy policies; climate justice},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this paper, we take inspiration from original institutional economics (OIE) as an approach to study value change within the highly complex assembly of sociotechnical transformations that make up the energy transition. OIE is examined here as a suitable perspective, as it combines Dewey’s pragmatist philosophy and a methodological interactionist perspective on value change, behavior and institutions, with technology figuring as a transformational factor. This combination overcomes conceptual and methodological shortcomings of alternative accounts of values. We will present the contours of an OIE based conceptual framework connecting nature, humans, technology, the economic process, society, culture and institutions and habits, valuation and behavior. We illustrate how to use this framework to examine and understand how environmental, ecologic, safety, economic, and social concerns about the energy transition are (re)framed as (new) values in the belief systems and habits of individuals and groups. Moreover, we will explore how that may give rise to collective action, via the institutionalization of such revised values in the procedures, arrangements, norms and incentives guiding transactions. As such, this approach allows us in a fine-grained manner to conceptually and theoretically understand the way in which values change in the energy-transition, as a complex interaction of technology development and social relations.},

  abstract = {The value of a non-pecuniary (free) product is inherently difficult to assess. A pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing OSS usage by millions of global firms. We first estimate the supply-side value by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demand side value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is \$4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at \$8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84\% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96\% of the demand-side value is created by only 5\% of OSS developers.},

  abstract = {The EU goals for renewable electricity cause significant changes of electrical loads in distribution systems, in which most renewable electricity sources are integrated. This poses a challenge for distribution system operators (DSOs) as their networks are not designed for such load changes. DSOs could use networks more efficiently with demand side management (DSM), where consumers of electricity alter their consumption patterns, shifting (production/consumption) loads in the distribution system. In such a setting, consumers would trade DSM services with the DSOs. However, currently, DSOs follow the ‘copper plate approach’, which assumes the system should have sufficient capacity to ensure that the desired volumes of electricity can be transported. This seeks to guarantee regulated third party access (rTPA) for all system users. Next to rTPA, based on regulated tasks, DSOs should ensure secure, reliable and efficient systems. In doing so, the DSOs are bound by unbundling requirements, which do not allow them to be involved in any activities other than those related to distribution. Therefore, especially production and supply are not allowed. Still, it seems debatable whether EU law allows DSOs to apply DSM, as it has an impact on both the access conditions to the electricity system, and the production, supply and trade of electricity. This article further analyses how DSM relates to the legal framework of DSOs, which obstacles are present, and how DSM could be traded between DSOs and system users.},

This article examines zonal market designs and their compatibility with ongoing energy transitions, focusing on two types of zonal market designs: the Nordic market with numerous, smaller zones, and the German “copper plate approach” with one, national zone. It assesses the dominant ideas and institutional logics within the two market designs. Perceptions of what kind of market design works best and is most efficient vary significantly, in line with the roles and interests of dominant stakeholders. Overall, the Nordic market is found to be better aligned with the energy transition in terms of flexibility, portfolio effects and system costs. The German market has considerably higher system costs but provides better conditions for long-term trading.},

The essays in this thematic section seek to redress that deficiency. This introductory essay raises some key questions and summarizes various presentations on energy and religion, as these were held at the 2010 conference of the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science (IRAS). Some presentations described the energy landscape and provided data and perspectives needed for sound policy. Others raised ethical and religious considerations for energy decisions as the transition from nonrenewable to renewable sources is faced. Some posed the challenges of the energy transition to religion itself. Yet others offered examples of sustainable energy use and/or promising sources for meeting future needs sustainably. At the conclusion of the conference, presenters crafted a common “Statement on Energy and Climate Change” that includes a “Call to Action.” The “Energy Statement” follows as an appendix.},

In this paper, we develop time series estimates of annual nominal and real investment and real capital stocks in OSS in the United States. We use data on OSS projects from GitHub, the largest OSS platform with over 31 million users and developers worldwide. We collect 5.2 million project repositories, containing metadata such as author, license, commits (approved code edits), and lines of code. Following methods used in software engineering to estimate the resource cost associated with creating OSS, we use lines of code and project complexity as the measure of effort to estimate the time spent on software development. In addition, we use existing methodologies for measurement of software in the U.S. national economic accounts to estimate both the annual investment and the capital stocks in software that is shared on GitHub. Our estimates show that U.S. investment in OSS was \$38 billion and the real capital stock nearly \$120 billion (constant 2012 U.S. dollars) in 2019.},
